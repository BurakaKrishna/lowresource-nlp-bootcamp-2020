# CMU LTI Low Resource NLP Bootcamp 2020

This is a page for a low-resource natural language and speech processing bootcamp held by the Carnegie Mellon University Language Technologies Institute in May 2020. The bootcamp was held virtually for some visitors to the institute, but we are making the videos and materials available for those interested in learning on your own.
